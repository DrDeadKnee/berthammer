# BERTHAMMER

In its most grandiose form, this project will have a few phases:

1. Scrape Wahapedia's AOS Core and Faction Rules.
2. Prepare a dataset with the core and faction rules.
3. Fine-tune BERT on the new dataset
4. Eplore the embeddings. Can I predict faction from the embeddings?
5. Scrape tournament data
6. Fine-tune embeddings against tournament data

It'sunlikely I'll be able to go through all of these in my spare time - 
phase 5 in particular may be impossible.

At least I'll learn something.
